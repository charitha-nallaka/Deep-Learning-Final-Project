# Project Title: Image Classification for Medical Diagnosis

## Group Members:
- Sam Stokes (Data Preprocessing, Model Development)
- Charitha Nallaka (Dataset Collection, Evaluation)

## Project Overview:
This project involves using three distinct datasets to solve machine learning problems. We will use a medical imaging dataset for tumor classification, a sentiment analysis dataset for text classification, and a speech dataset for speech emotion recognition. The goal is to build a robust model that can classify each of these types accurately.

## Datasets:
1. **Breast Cancer Imaging Dataset**
   - **Modality**: Image
   - **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset)
   - **Description**: The dataset consists of mammogram images with labels indicating whether the tumor is malignant or benign.
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Data**
   - **Modality**: Text
   - **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dataset)
   - **Description**: This dataset contains tweets labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.

3. **Speech Emotion Recognition Dataset**
   - **Modality**: Audio
   - **Source**: [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/dataset)
   - **Description**: This dataset contains audio recordings with labels indicating emotions like happy, sad, and angry.

## Machine Learning Problem Definitions:
1. **Breast Cancer Imaging**
   - **Problem Type**: Binary Classification
   - **Target Labels**: {M (Malignant), B (Benign)}

2. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Problem Type**: Multiclass Classification
   - **Target Labels**: {Positive, Negative, Neutral}

3. **Speech Emotion Recognition**
   - **Problem Type**: Multiclass Classification
   - **Target Labels**: {Happy, Sad, Angry, Neutral}
